Beep in, beep out 🤖

This is a simple clockin system.

I was tired of recording my working time every single day, so I made this! 

(with the help of Professor G  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/gmail-new.png" alt="Gmail" width="30" /> and Professor C)

🥤🥗🍔🍗🍟🥓 12:00-13:00 is my lunch break, so this period will not be counted as working time.
