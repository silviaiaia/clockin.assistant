Beep in, beep out 🤖

This is a simple clockin system.

I was tired of recording my working time every single day, so I made this! 
(with the help of Professor G <img src="[https://www.google.com/images/branding/product/2x/gemini_2024_color_48dp.png](https://www.gstatic.com/lamda/images/gemini_aurora_thumbnail_4g_e74822ff0ca4259beb718.png)" alt="Gemini" width="20" /> and Professor C)

🥤🥗🍔🍗🍟🥓 12:00-13:00 is my lunch break, so this period will not be counted as working time.
