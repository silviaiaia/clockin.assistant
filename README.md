### This is a simple clock-in system.

I was tired of recording my working time every single day, so I made this! 
(with the help of Professor Claude and Professor Gemini)

ü•§ü•óüçîüçóüçüü•ì 12:00-13:00 is my lunch break, so this period will not be counted as working time.

### Features

This system is browser-based, and built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to track their work hours and calculate wages without needing a backend server, as all data is stored locally in the browser's localStorage.

- **Real-time Clock Display** : shows current time.

- **Clock-in/Clock-out Functionality** : records start and end times for work sessions.

- **Customizable Hourly Rate** : you can set and save your hourly wage.

- **Work Hours and Wage Calculation** : automatically calculates total work hours and estimated wage for each session (usually on a daily basis).

  - Work hours are rounded to the nearest half-hour (0.5 hours).

  - A one-hour lunch break is automatically deducted if the work period spans from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM.

  - Wages are rounded to the nearest hundred.

- **Local Data Storage** : all records are saved in browser's localStorage, ensuring data persists even if you close the tab.

- **Reporting** : generate and export weekly or monthly work reports as a text file.

- **Data Management** :

  - Fix Records: recalculates work hours and wages for all records based on the current hourly rate.

  - Delete Records: allows you to delete individual work entries.

  - Clear All Data: provides an option to permanently delete all stored data.

### Important Notes

- This is a front-end only application. Data is stored exclusively on your local device's browser. If you use a different computer or browser, your data will not be available.

- Clearing your browser's cache or local storage will permanently delete all your clock-in records.

- The system currently deducts a fixed one-hour lunch break for work sessions that include the 12 PM to 1 PM period. This logic might need to be adjusted for more complex work schedules.

- The system currently does not have the function of calculating over-time paid, all work hours would be counted with the input wages.
