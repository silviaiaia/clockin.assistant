This is a simple clockin system.

I was tired of recording my working time every single day, so I made this! 

(with the help of Professor G <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/gemini.png" alt="Gemini" width="20" /> 
and Professor C <img src="https://img.icons8.com/external-soft-fill-juicy-fish/60/external-ai-artificial-intelligence-soft-fill-juicy-fish.png" alt="Claude" width="20" />)

🥤🥗🍔🍗🍟🥓 12:00-13:00 is my lunch break, so this period will not be counted as working time.
