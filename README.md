Beep in, beep out 🤖

This is a simple clockin system.

I was tired of recording my working time every single day, so I made this! 

(with the help of Professor G  <img src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/product/2x/gemini_2024_color_48dp.png" alt="Gemini" width="10" /> and Professor C)

🥤🥗🍔🍗🍟🥓 12:00-13:00 is my lunch break, so this period will not be counted as working time.
